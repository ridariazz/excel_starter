# Kickstarter Analysis Project 
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to compare the different campaigns based on their launch dates as well as their fundraising goals. We've analyzed data by creating pivot tables for specific parent categories and created visualization of the data by creating line plots. Moreover, we calculated the percentages of the failed, successful and canceled projects to determine how these outcomes effected the overall campaign. In this project, we will analyze how projects in categories **theater** and **plays** based on the month of their launch performed. 
Our analysis has determined there is in fact a trend between the time of the year a campaign in launched effecting its overall performance.
